# Habit-Tracker-Project
# 📝 Habit Tracker (JavaFX)

This is a basic Habit Tracking desktop application built using **JavaFX** and **Maven**.

> ⚠️ This project was created during my early exploration of software development. While I'm currently focused on **cybersecurity**, I wanted to share this as part of my learning journey.

## 🚀 Features

- JavaFX GUI with multiple scenes
- Login interface (FXML)

## ⚠️ Note from the Developer

This was my **first Java project**, and while it functions, it may contain:

- Glitches or design flaws
- Hardcoded values or unoptimized logic
- UI inconsistencies

It was a learning experience and is no longer maintained.
